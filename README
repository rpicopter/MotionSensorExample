MotionSensorExample
===================

MPU6050/MPU6500/MPU9150/MPU9250 over I2c for RaspberryPi using official Invensense libraries (v5.1):
http://www.invensense.com/developers/index.php?_r=downloads


This is a sample program for testing your MPU Motion Sensor with Rasperry Pi.
It does all the initialization and gathers:
- gyro
- accel
- quaternion
- compass (for MPU9XXX)
- temperature

and calculates Yaw, Pitch, Roll in degrees which in turn is displayed as an output.


**Wiring**
I2C uses only2 wires for data transmission: SCL and SDA
RPi pin 3 -> MPU SDA
RPi pin 5 -> MPU SCL


You will also need to provide power (3.3V) to your MPU. You can use external power or hook it up with RPi.
For example:
RPi pin 1 (3.3V) -> MPU VCC
RPi pin 6 (Ground) -> MPU GND


**Compilation:**
On RPi, edit MotionSensor/Makefile and adjust CXX_OPTS to specify your board (-DMPU6050 for MPU6050, -DMPU9150 for MPU9150), issue make


**Cross compiling:**
Edit all Makefiles in all directories and adjust CXX. Issue make


**Running:**
  mstest

....

**Additional info:**
Current setup is to run at 40Hz, this can be adjusted in the ms_open function, however note that your code will need to read the values with respective speed or quicker. Otherwise the MPU fifo buffer will overflown.

To read MPU see ms_update - it calls 'dmp read fifo' in a while loop. This means that if fifo is empty this will stall until a packet is available.
